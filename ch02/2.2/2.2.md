the following languages. In each case show that your grammar is correct.

1. Arithmetic expressions in postfix notation.
2. Left-associative lists of identifiers separated by commas.
3. Right-associative lists of identifiers separated by commas.
4. Arithmetic expressions of integers and identifiers with the four binary operators +, -, *, /.
5. Add unary plus and minus to the arithmetic operators of 4.

#### Answer

```
1. E -> E E op | num

2. list -> list , id | id

3. list -> id , list | id

4. expr -> expr + term | expr - term | term
   term -> term * factor | term / factor | factor
   factor -> id | num | (expr)

5. expr -> expr + term | expr - term | term
   term -> term * unary | term / unary | unary
   unary -> + factor | - factor | factor
   factor - > id | num | (expr)
```

### 2.2.5

1. Show that all binary strings generated by the following grammar have values divisible by 3. Hint. Use induction on the number of nodes in a parse tree.

    num -> 11 | 1001 | num 0 | num num

2.  Does the grammar generate all binary strings with values divisible by 3?

#### Answer

1. Proof

    Any string derived from the grammar can be considered to be a sequence consisting of 11 and 1001, where each sequence element is possibly suffixed with a 0.

    Let `n` be the set of positions where `11` is placed. `11` is said to be at position `i` if the first `1` in `11` is at position `i`, where `i` starts at 0 and
    grows from least significant to most significant bit.

    Let `m` be the equivalent set for `1001`.

    The sum of any string produced by the grammar is:

    sum

    = Σ<sub>n</sub> (2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>) * 2 <sup>n</sup> + Σ<sub>m</sub> (2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>) * 2<sup>m</sup>

    = Σ<sub>n</sub> 3 * 2 <sup>n</sup> + Σ<sub>m</sub> 9 * 2<sup>m</sup>

    This is clearly divisible by 3.


2. No. Consider the string "10101", which is divisible by 3, but cannot be
   derived from the grammar.

    Readers seeking a more formal proof can read about it below:

    **Proof**:

    Every number divisible by 3 can be written in the form `3k`. We will consider `k > 0` (though it would be valid to consider `k` to be an arbitrary integer).

    Note that every part of num(11, 1001 and 0) is divisible by 3, if the grammar could generate all the numbers divisible by 3, we can get a production for binary k from num's production:

    ```
    3k = num   -> 11 | 1001 | num 0 | num num
     k = num/3 -> 01 | 0011 | k 0   | k k
     k         -> 01 | 0011 | k 0   | k k
    ```

    It is obvious that any value of `k` that has more than 2 consecutive bits set to 1 can never be produced. This can be confirmed by the example given in the beginning:

    10101 is 3*7, hence, k = 7 = 111 in binary. Because 111 has more than 2
    consecutive 1's in binary, the grammar will never produce 21.


### 2.2.6

Construct a context-free grammar for roman numerals.

**Note:** we just consider a subset of roman numerals which is less than 4k.


#### Answer

[wikipedia: Roman_numerals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)

- via wikipedia, we can categorize the single roman numerals into 4 groups:

    ```
    I, II, III | I V | V, V I, V II, V III | I X
    ```

    then get the production:

    ```
    digit -> smallDigit | I V | V smallDigit | I X
    smallDigit -> I | II | III | ε
    ```



- and we can find a simple way to map roman to arabic numerals. For example:

    - XII => X, II => 10 + 2 => 12
    - CXCIX => C, XC, IX => 100 + 90 + 9 => 199
    - MDCCCLXXX => M, DCCC, LXXX => 1000 + 800 + 80 => 1880

- via the upper two rules, we can derive the production:

    romanNum -> thousand hundred ten digit

    thousand -> M | MM | MMM | ε

    hundred -> smallHundred | C D | D smallHundred | C M

    smallHundred -> C | CC | CCC  | ε

    ten -> smallTen | X L | L smallTen | X C

    smallTen -> X | XX | XXX | ε

    digit -> smallDigit | I V | V smallDigit | I X

    smallDigit -> I | II | III  | ε
