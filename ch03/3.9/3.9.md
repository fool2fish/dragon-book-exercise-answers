### 3.9.2

Use Algorithm 3.36 to convert the regular expressions of
Ex­ercise 3.7.3 directly to deterministic finite automata.

#### Answer

1. (a|b)\*

    - Syntax tree
    
        ![3 9 2-1-1](assets/3.9.2-1-1.gif)

    - firstpos and lastpos for nodes in the syntax tree

    - The function followpos
    
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>node n</th>
                    <th>followpos(n)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>{1, 2, 3}</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>{1, 2, 3}</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>∅</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
     
- Steps
     
   The value of firstpos for the root of the tree is {1, 2, 3}, so this set is the start state of D. Call this set of states A. We compute Dtran[A, a] and Dtran[A, b]. Among the positions of A, 1 correspond to a, while 2 correspond to b. Thus Dtran[A, a] = followpos(1) = {1, 2, 3}， Dtran[A, b] = followpos(2) = {1, 2, 3}. Both the results are set A, so dose not have new state, end the computation.
         
- DFA

2. (a\*|b\*)\*

3. ((ε|a)|b\*)\*

4. (a|b)\*abb(a|b)\*
    

### 3.9.3 !

We can prove that two regular expressions are equivalent by
showing that their minimum-state DFA's are the same up to renaming of states.
Show in this way that the following regular expressions: (a|b)\*, (a\*|b\*)\*, and
((ε|a)b\*)\* are all equivalent. Note: You may have constructed the DFA's for
these expressions in response to Exercise 3.7.3.

#### Answer

Refer to the answers of 3.7.3 and 3.9.2-1

### 3.9.4 !

Construct the minimum-state DFA's for the following regular expressions:

1. (a|b)\*a(a|b)
2. (a|b)\*a(a|b)(a|b)
3. (a|b)\*a(a|b)(a|b)(a|b)

Do you see a pattern?

### 3.9.5 !!

To make formal the informal claim of Example 3.25, show
that any deterministic finite automaton for the regular expression

(a|b)\*a(a|b)...(a|b)

where (a|b) appears n - 1 times at the end, must have at least 2n states. Hint:
Observe the pattern in Exercise 3.9.4. What condition regarding the history of
inputs does each state represent?
