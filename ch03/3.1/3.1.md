# Exercises for Section 3.1

### 3.1.1

Divide the following C++ program:

```
float limitedSquare(x){float x;
  /* returns x-squared, nut never more than 100 */
  return (x <= -10.0 || x >= 10.0) ? 100 : x*x;
}
```

into appropriate lexemes, using the discussion of Section 3.1.2 as a guide.
Which lexemes should get associated lexical values? What should those values be?

#### Answer

```
<keyword, float> <id, limitedSquare> <delimiter, '('> <id, x> <delimiter, ')'> <delimiter, '{'> <keyword, float> <id, x> <delimiter, ';'>
<keyword, return> <delimiter, '('> <id, x> <operator,'<='> <literal, -10.0> < operator, '||'> <id, x> < operator, '>='> < literal, 10.0> <delimiter, ')'> < operator, '?'> < literal, 100> < operator, ':'> <id, x> < operator, '*'> <id, x> <delimiter, ';'>
<delimiter, '}'>

```

### 3.1.2

Tagged languages like HTML or XML are different from conventional programming
languages in that the punctuation (tags) are either very numerous (as in HTML)
or a user-definable set (as in XML). Further, tags can often have parameters.
Suggest how to divide the following HTML document:

```
Here is a photo of <b>my house</b>;
<p><img src="house.gif"/><br/>
see <a href="morePix.html">More Picture</a> if you
liked that one.</p>
```

into appropriate lexemes. Which lexemes should get associated lexical values, and what should those values be?

#### Answer

```
<text, "Here is a photo of"> <nodestart, b> <text, "my house"> <nodeend, b> < operator, ';'>
<nodestart, p> <selfendnode, img> <tag, img> <keyword, src> < operator, '='> <literal, "../assests/house.gif"> <keyword, alt> < operator, '='> <literal, "Beatiful House!"> <selfendnode, br>
<text, "see"> <nodestart, a> <keyword, href> < operator, '='> <literal, "./morePics.html"> <text, "More Picture"> <nodeend, a>
<text, "if you liked that one."> <nodeend, p>
```
