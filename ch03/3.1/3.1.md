# Exercises for Section 3.1

### 3.1.1

Divide the following C++ program:

```
float limitedSquare(x) float x; {
  /* returns x-squared, but never more than 100 */
  return (x <= -10.0 || x >= 10.0) ? 100 : x*x;
}
```

into appropriate lexemes, using the discussion of Section 3.1.2 as a guide.
Which lexemes should get associated lexical values? What should those values be?

#### Answer

```
<float> <id, limitedSquaare> <(> <id, x> <)> <float> <id, x> <;> <{>
<return> <(> <id, x> <op,"<="> <num, -10.0> <op, "||"> <id, x> <op, ">=">
<num, 10.0> <)> <op, "?"> <num, 100> <op, ":"> <id, x> <op, "*"> <id, x> <;>
<}>
```

### 3.1.2

Tagged languages like HTML or XML are different from conventional programming
languages in that the punctuation (tags) are either very numerous (as in HTML)
or a user-definable set (as in XML). Further, tags can often have parameters.
Suggest how to divide the following HTML document:

```
Here is a photo of <b>my house</b>:
<p><img src="house.gif"><br>
see <a href="morePix.html">More Pictures</a> if you
liked that one.</p>
```

into appropriate lexemes. Which lexemes should get associated lexical values, and what should those values be?

#### Answer

```
<text, "Here is a photo of"> <nodestart, b> <text, "my house"> <nodeend, b> <text, ":">
<nodestart, p> <nodestart, img> <attr, src, house.gif> <nodestart, br>
<text, "see"> <nodestart, a> <attr, href, morePix.html> <text, "More Pictures"> <nodeend, a>
<text, "if you liked that one."> <nodestart, p>
```
