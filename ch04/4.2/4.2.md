by at least one 1.

### 4.2.4

There is an extended grammar notation in common use.
In this notation, square and curly braces in production bodies are metasymbols
(like -> or |) with the following meanings:

1. Square braces around a grammar symbol or symbols denotes that these
constructs are optional. Thus, production A -> X\[Y\]Z has the same
effect as the two productions A -> XYZ and A -> XZ.
2. Curly braces around a grammar symbol or symbols says that these sym­bols
may be repeated any number of times, including zero times. Thus,
A -> X{YZ} has the same effect as the infinite sequence of productions
A -> X, A -> XYZ, A -> XYZYZ, and so on.

Show that these two extensions do not add power to grammars; that is, any
language that can be generated by a grammar with these extensions can be
generated by a grammar without the extensions.

#### Proof

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>extended grammar</th>
            <th>not extended grammar</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>A -> X[Y]Z</td>
            <td>A -> XZ | XYZ</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A -> X{YZ}</td>
            <td>A -> XB<br/>B -> YZB | ε</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### 4.2.5

Use the braces described in Exercise 4.2.4 to simplify the
following grammar for statement blocks and conditional statements:

```
stmt -> if expr then stmt else stmt
      | if stmt them stmt
      | begin stmtList end
stmtList -> stmt; stmtList | stmt
```

#### Answer

```
stmt -> if expr then stmt [else stmt]
      | begin stmtList end
stmtList -> stmt [; stmtList]
```

### 4.2.6

Extend the idea of Exercise 4.2.4 to allow any regular expres­sion
of grammar symbols in the body of a production. Show that this extension
does not allow grammars to define any new languages.

#### Proof

Every regular grammar has a corresponding not extended grammar

### 4.2.7 !

A grammar symbol X (terminal or nonterminal) is useless if
there is no derivation of the form S =\*=> wXy =\*=> wxy. That is, X can never
appear in the derivation of any sentence.

1. Give an algorithm to eliminate from a grammar all productions containing useless symbols.
2. Apply your algorithm to the grammar:

    ```
    S -> 0 | A
    A -> AB
    B -> 1
    ````

### 4.2.8

The grammar in Fig. 4.7 generates declarations for a sin­gle
numerical identifier; these declarations involve four different, independent
properties of numbers.

```
stmt -> declare id optionList
optionList -> optionList option | ε
option -> mode | scale | precision | base
mode -> real | complex
scale -> fixed | floating
precision -> single | double
base -> binary | decimal
```

1. Generalize the grammar of Fig. 4.7 by allowing n options Ai, for some
fixed n and for i = 1,2... ,n, where Ai can be either ai or bi· Your
grammar should use only 0(n) grammar symbols and have a total length
of productions that is O(n).

2. ! The grammar of Fig. 4.7 and its generalization in part (a) allow declarations
that are contradictory and/or redundant, such as

    declare foo real fixed real floating

    We could insist that the syntax of the language forbid such declarations;
    that is, every declaration generated by the grammar has exactly one value
    for each of the n options. If we do, then for any fixed n there is only a finite
    number of legal declarations. The language of legal declarations thus has
    a grammar (and also a regular expression), as any finite language does.
    The obvious grammar, in which the start symbol has a production for
    every legal declaration has n! productions and a total production length
    of O(n x n!). You must do better: a total production length that is O(n2^n)

3. !! Show that any grammar for part (b) must have a total production length of at least 2n.
4. What does part (c) say about the feasibility of enforcing nonredundancy
and noncontradiction among options in declarations via the syntax of the programming language?

#### Answer

1、

```
stmt -> declare id optionList
optionList -> optionList option | ε
option -> A_1 | A_2 | … | A_n
A_1 -> a_1 | b_1
A_2 -> a_2 | b_2
…
A_n -> a_n | b_n
```
